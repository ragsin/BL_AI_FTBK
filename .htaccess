# BEGIN SPA ROUTING
# This configuration allows for client-side routing in Single Page Applications.
# It redirects all requests for non-existent files to the main index.html file,
# allowing the JavaScript router to handle the path.

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On

  # Set the base path for the rewrite rules.
  # If your app is in a subdirectory, change this to /your-subdirectory/
  RewriteBase /

  # Don't rewrite the index.html file itself.
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]

  # If the requested file or directory doesn't exist...
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l

  # ...redirect the request to index.html
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>

# END SPA ROUTING

# Additionally, if you are using Hostinger or a similar service that may
# not automatically serve index.html for directories, you can add this line:
DirectoryIndex index.html

# It can also be beneficial to handle 404 errors by redirecting to a
# custom 404 page that then redirects back to the SPA, though the above
# rewrite rules are generally sufficient. For hosts that support it:
ErrorDocument 404 /404.html
